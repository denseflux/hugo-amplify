<h2 id="technical-information-about-this-websites-accessibility"><strong>Technical information about this website&rsquo;s accessibility</strong></h2>
<p>The University of Warwick is committed to making this website accessible, in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.</p>
<p>This service is <strong>partially</strong> compliant with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1 AA standard</a>, due to the non-compliances listed below.</p>
<h3 id="non-accessible-content"><strong>Non-accessible content</strong></h3>
<p>We are working to meet the compliance as specified in The Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018. Meanwhile, the content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons.</p>
<h2 id="non-compliance-with-the-accessibility-regulations"><strong>Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations</strong></h2>
<h3 id="issues-with-technology"><strong>Issues with technology</strong>** **</h3>
<p>The vast majority of our website works correctly on any web technology – we have built this website using open source software that has given consideration to accessibility as a core requirement of the technical platform, however some of the ways we have implemented and customised this software may alter its accessibility.</p>
<p>Drupal Accessibility Statement <a href="https://www.drupal.org/about/features/accessibility">https://www.drupal.org/about/features/accessibility</a></p>
<p>For security reasons, we only support <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/services/its/glossary/?selectedLetter=T#TLS-1.2">TLS 1.2</a> and higher security protocols, and this means that some older <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/services/its/glossary/?selectedLetter=W#Web-Browser">Web Browser</a> will not show the site.</p>
<h3 id="how-do-we-test-this-website">How do we test this website?</h3>
<p>eResearch, the IT Services team responsible for publishing and maintaining this website test the customisations to these platforms that we make against the <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/services/its/servicessupport/browsersupport">web browsers we support</a> and we test our website infrastructure in these browsers as a minimum along with tablets and mobile devices too at the point of design.</p>
<p>For sites released since September 2019 we have a checklist that includes accessibility before we release a new site, or make significant changes. We use the Google Chrome <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/audits/button-name">Lighthouse</a> tool for web developers and manually test against the accessibility objectives covered in this statement.</p>
<h3 id="what-we-are-doing-to-improve-accessibility"><strong>What we are doing to improve accessibility?</strong></h3>
<p>Our first priority is to ensure that accessibility is core to current and future work developed by the eResearch team by design, and where we work with academic colleagues who use this website to publish material, giving them tools and guidance on how to do so in an accessible way.</p>
<p>In addition, through our ongoing commitment to maintaining completed web outputs for past research, we will keep the core open source software patched and inherit any accessibility improvements made to these underlying platforms. We will also be auditing and testing our older websites to update and make our accessibility statements more informative and where we can reasonably make changes to our systems to make them more accessible, we will plan to make those changes.</p>
