      <description>This a post that could appear biased in favour of the left in British politics, but I assure you I would say the same thing were it the other way around.
What we&amp;rsquo;ve been seeing on the front covers of newspapers in the run-up to the election, such as The Sun on the 9th Dec, is exemplary of how our media doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to be performing its role as part of British democracy.</description>

      <description>After 3 long years of Brexit debating in parliament and 4 Brexit extensions, parliament has (un) surprisingly decided to take the decision back to the people by passing a law to hold a General Election on the 12th of December 2019. This is quite possibly the most important election of our lifetime. For many young people who did not have the chance to vote in the 2016 referendum or the 2017 snap election, this will be their first ever opportunity to vote in a General Election.</description>
