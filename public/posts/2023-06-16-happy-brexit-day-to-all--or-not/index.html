<p><strong>Was this the right move?</strong></p>
<p>It was blatantly obvious that Boris Johnson had no more control over Parliament as his first 10 bills were defeated in the House of Commons. Johnson’s minority government had no chance of getting anything through. Perhaps it was the right choice to call an election. Although, what will happen if the election results in a similarly divided parliament? Maybe it is time that parliamentarians do their job by putting their differences aside and coming to a resolution on Brexit.</p>
<p><strong>Tactical Voting</strong></p>
<p>As our First Past the Post voting system encourages people to vote tactically and this is one of the most important elections of our generation, tactical voting will be a tempting choice this December. Putting a specific political outcome over your political affiliation is a tough decision to make. This is a symptom of the many failings of our political system. I will personally be looking into this option and will post an article about this soon!</p>
<p>No matter what, if you are able to vote, PLEASE register and turn up! This election will decide our future relationship with Europe and how we choose to progress with Brexit.</p>
